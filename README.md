# clicky-game
A Tarot style clicky game for assignment #15

1. I was able to create a visual layout for how I want my app to look. Here is a screen grab:

2. I broke out seperate components for each card, attempting to use the React structure, but the cards never seemed to compile to the App.

3. The next step is to write code that randomly selects cards (maybe from an array) and renders them into the cardHolder divs.

4. I would then need click handlers on each card that trigger a shuffling of the array, a rerendering of the DOM and an update the players score.

5. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to piece together what much of that code would be by looking at in class work with React.

Thanks,
Jeff
